# Training-React-Query-in-dept

Inspired by React Query Tutorial from [Codevolution Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLC3y8-rFHvwjTELCrPrcZlo6blLBUspd2) by [Vishwas Gopinav](https://github.com/gopinav)

"I used Vite instead of create-react-app. I added TypeScript support and also made some modifications to the base design. I have already learned React-Query (tanstack-query) with the documentation, examples, and blogs and YouTube videos. I have also already used it in my work. But Codevolution is really the best teacher I have found on this subject. I also recommend you to watch his different playlists which are, for the ones I have watched (especially react-hook-form), at the same level. It covers the basic concepts very well explained, as sometimes with other teachers, but Codevolution goes deeper into the subject.

## launch server

If you go to http://localhost:4000/superheroes <br>
You'll have superheroes data from db.json
