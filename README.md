# Training-React-Query-in-dept

Inspired by React Query Tutorial from [Codevolution Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLC3y8-rFHvwjTELCrPrcZlo6blLBUspd2) by [Vishwas Gopinav](https://github.com/gopinav)

I used Vite instead of create-react-app to test this framework. I added TypeScript support and also little modified the base design a bit.

I have already learned React-Query (tanstack-query) through the documentation, examples, and blogs and YouTube videos. I have also used it in my work. But Codevolution is really the best teacher I have found on this subject. I also recommend watching his different playlists which, for the ones I have watched (like react-hook-form), are at the same level. He explains the basic concepts very well, as sometimes with other teachers, but Codevolution goes further in depth

## launch server
To start the project we need to serve data with json-Server.

If you go to http://localhost:4000/superheroes <br>
You'll have superheroes data from db.json

## launch App
